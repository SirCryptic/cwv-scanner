<h3 align="center">Web Application Vulnerability Scanner. [python Version]</h3>

This is a simple web application vulnerability scanner that checks if a given URL or IP address is vulnerable to common web application security vulnerabilities. The tool is designed to help website owners and security researchers identify vulnerabilities in their web applications that can be exploited by attackers.

## Installation
```bash
pip install cwv-scanner
```

## Usage
```bash
cwv-scanner example.com
```

## Vulnerabilities Checked by cwv-scanner

The scanner checks for the following 36 vulnerabilities:
